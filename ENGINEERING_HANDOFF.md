## **üìÖ Session Handoff: June 26, 2025, 4:22 PM Pacific**
**From**: Master Database Engineer (Alignment & Category Completion Phase)
**To**: Next Master Database Engineer

### **Session Summary: CRITICAL ALIGNMENT & PHASE 1 COMPLETION**
This session was a major success. We achieved perfect alignment on the project's architecture, identified the root cause of data loss, and successfully executed Phase 1 of our new master plan.

- ‚úÖ **Established "DataNest Triple-Lock" Master Plan**: A systematic, evidence-based process for 100% data capture.
- ‚úÖ **Unified Audit Completed**: A definitive report on our true status across the Data Dictionary, Schema, and Loader.
- ‚úÖ **"Building Characteristics" Phase 1 Complete**: Successfully added 32 columns to the schema, updated the loader, and validated the new fields with a production test.
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Consolidated**: This single handoff document now replaces all previous versions.

## **üìä CURRENT PROJECT STATUS: ACCURATE & VERIFIED**

### **The Four Layers (Our Source of Truth)**
1.  **Data Dictionary**: 449 fields defined across 12 categories.
2.  **TSV Source File**: 6.2 GB file with all 449 columns available.
3.  **Database Schema**: 209 columns, a solid foundation.
4.  **Production Loader**: The engine, now mapping **~78 fields** (up from ~42).

### **Category Completion Status (Post-Building Characteristics)**

## **üöÄ THE MASTER PLAN: SYSTEMATIC CATEGORY COMPLETION**

Our "DataNest Triple-Lock" process ensures methodical, error-free completion of each category.

*   **Step 1: Verify Evidence** (Data Dictionary & TSV Headers)
*   **Step 2: Update Foundation** (Database Schema Migration)
*   **Step 3: Update Engine** (Production Loader Field Mapping)
*   **Step 4: Validate** (Test with Sample Data)

### **Next Target: Property Sale (47 Fields)**
-   **Why**: Crucial data for market analysis, trends, and valuation. It is the next largest, most impactful category.
-   **Action**: Apply the "Triple-Lock" process to the 47 "Property Sale" fields.

---

## **üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION**

1.  **Extract "Property Sale" Headers**: Run the `get_category_fields.py` script to get the list of all 47 TSV headers for the "Property Sale" category.
2.  **Create Migration `007`**: Write `007_complete_property_sale.sql` to add the necessary columns to the `properties` table.
3.  **Run Single Migration**: Use `run_single_migration.py` to apply the changes to the database.
4.  **Update Loader**: Add the 47 new field mappings to `enhanced_production_loader_batch4a.py`.
5.  **Validate**: Run the loader with a 2,000-record sample to test the new mappings.
6.  **Commit & Handoff**: Update this document and commit all changes.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**
-   **Zero Assumptions**: The `data_dictionary.txt` is the only source of truth.
-   **One Category at a Time**: Do not move to the next category until the current one is 100% complete and validated.
-   **Use the Proven Scripts**: The `run_single_migration.py` and `get_category_fields.py` scripts are designed for this process.

The system is stable, our process is proven, and the path to 100% data capture is clear.
