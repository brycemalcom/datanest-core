# 🛡️ HOW TO RUN BULLETPROOF LOADER LOCALLY (Simple Instructions)

## 🎯 **GOAL: Load ALL 5,000,000 Records with Zero Data Loss**

### **Step 1: Open Your Own PowerShell Terminal**
1. Press **Windows Key + R**
2. Type: `powershell` 
3. Press **Enter**
4. You'll see: `PS C:\Users\bryce>`

### **Step 2: Navigate to Your Project**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\bryce\OneDrive\Documents\datanest-core-platform"
```

### **Step 3: Run the Bulletproof Loader**
```powershell
python scripts\bulletproof_complete_loader.py
```

## ⏰ **What to Expect**

### **Normal Process:**
- **Time**: 30-40 minutes (it's sequential for maximum reliability)
- **Progress**: You'll see chunk-by-chunk progress updates
- **Records**: Target is 5,000,000 records (fixing the missing 150K)

### **What You'll See:**
```

✅ Successful Chunks: 200
❌ Failed Chunks: 0
⏱️  Time: 35.2 minutes
🚀 Rate: 2,369 records/second
```

## 🚨 **If Something Goes Wrong**

### **Error Messages:**
- **"Failed to load database configuration"**: Database connection issue
- **"No TSV file found"**: File path issue  
- **"Column count mismatch"**: TSV file reading issue

### **Quick Fixes:**
1. **Database Issue**: Run `python scripts\check_status.py` to test connection
2. **File Issue**: Check if the TSV file exists at the path in the script
3. **General Issue**: Try running `python scripts\check_schema.py` first

## 📊 **Check Progress During Run**

**Open a SECOND PowerShell window** and run:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\bryce\OneDrive\Documents\datanest-core-platform"
python scripts\check_status.py
```

This will show you current record count while the loader is running.

## ✅ **Verify Success After Completion**

```powershell
python scripts\check_status.py
```

**You should see:**
- **📊 Records loaded: 5,000,000** (or very close)
- **🗺️ States**: Alabama ~2.67M, Alaska ~334K, Arizona ~1.85M

## 🎯 **Why This Works Better Than Cursor**

- ✅ **No timeouts**: Your terminal won't stop the process
- ✅ **See all output**: Complete progress tracking
- ✅ **Stable connection**: Direct database connection
- ✅ **Business-friendly**: Just run one command and wait

## 📱 **Pro Tips**
1. **Don't close the terminal** while it's running
2. **Let it finish completely** - even if it seems slow
3. **Keep an eye on it** but don't interrupt
4. **The "individual field processing" approach** prevents the data alignment issues

## 🚀 **Ready to Go?**

Just copy this command into your PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\bryce\OneDrive\Documents\datanest-core-platform" ; python scripts\bulletproof_complete_loader.py
```

**That's it!** The loader will handle everything else and get you to 5,000,000 records.
